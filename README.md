# VAR and VECM Simulation in R

This repository demonstrates simulation, estimation, and stability analysis of Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models, with extensions toward cointegration and Vector Error Correction Models (VECM). The focus is on understanding stationarity, eigenvalue-based stability conditions, and multivariate dynamics through controlled simulations.

The project is intended as a pedagogical and research-oriented reference for multivariate time series modeling in econometrics.

## Model Framework

### VAR(p) Model

A VAR(p) process is defined as:

$Y_t = \sum_{i = 1}^{p}\left(A_i y_{t-i}\right) + u_t,
\quad u_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma_u)$

where:
- $Y_t \coloneqq (y_{1t}, \ldots, y_{nt})'$ is an n-dimensional vector of time series variables
- $A_i$ are coefficient matrices
- $u_t \coloneqq (u_{1t}, \ldots, u_{nt})'$ is an n-dimensional vector of white noise terms

---

## Stationarity and Stability

- For VAR(1), stationarity requires all eigenvalues of $A_1$ to lie strictly inside the unit circle.
- For VAR(p), stationarity is assessed using the eigenvalues of the **companion matrix**.
- Both stationary and nonstationary parameterizations are simulated to contrast their dynamic behavior.

## Simulation Design

- Sample size: \( T = 500 \)
- Innovations drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with correlated errors
- Separate simulations for:
  - VAR(1): stationary and nonstationary cases
  - VAR(2): stationary and nonstationary cases

---

## Estimation and Diagnostics

- VAR models are estimated using the `vars` package
- Lag order selection performed via information criteria
- Estimated coefficients are compared to true data-generating parameters
- Sample correlations and dynamic behavior are examined

## Visualizations

Time series plots illustrate the contrast between stationary and explosive dynamics, using line types suitable for black-and-white reproduction.

All figures generated by the scripts are saved to the `figures/` directory.

## Extensions

Planned extensions include:
- Johansen cointegration tests
- VECM representation and simulation
